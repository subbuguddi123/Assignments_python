        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Another way in which lists and strings are identical is that they both support the len() function, which returns the number of elements (or characters) in the sequence. For example:\n",

        "# using len() with a list\n",

        "Ans: In Python, tuples and lists are both used to store collections of elements, but they have some differences in terms of their properties and usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "One key difference is that lists are mutable, meaning that you can modify the contents of a list by adding, removing, or modifying elements. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning that once you create a tuple, you cannot modify its contents. For example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "# creating a list and modifying it\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list.append(4)\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "# creating a tuple and trying to modify it\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "my_tuple.append(4)  # This will result in an AttributeError\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Another difference is that lists use square brackets ([]) to enclose their elements, while tuples use parentheses (()). For example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "# creating a list\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "# creating a tuple\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists and tuples also have different methods available to them. For example, lists have methods like append(), insert(), and remove(), which allow you to add or remove elements from the list. Tuples, being immutable, don't have these methods. Instead, they have a few methods like count() and index() that allow you to perform operations on the elements of the tuple without modifying them. For example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "# using a list method\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list.append(4)\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "# using a tuple method\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 3)\n",
        "print(my_tuple.count(3))  # Output: 2\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of performance, tuples are generally faster than lists, since they are immutable and thus require less memory allocation and deallocation. However, lists are more flexible and versatile than tuples, since they can be modified and have more methods available to them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the main differences between tuples and lists in Python are their mutability, syntax, methods, and performance characteristics. Lists are mutable and use square brackets, while tuples are immutable and use parentheses. Lists have more methods available for modifying them, while tuples have a few methods for working with their contents without modifying them. Tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists, but less flexible and versatile."
